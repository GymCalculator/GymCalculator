# GymCalculator

GymCalculator provides lifters with a tool to pinpoint their strengths and weaknesses and compare their lifts with others. After entering the lifts that you train and your best set per lift, GymCalculator will provide you with a detailed breakdown of where you stand in comparison to other strength athletes, which muscle groups are lagging behind, and where you excel in comparison to other lifters at your level.

Additionally, GymCalculator offers other fitness-related calculators like calories loss per training and ideal calorie intake for your fitness goal.

## How is the strength score determined?

The strength score is closely related to the Wilks score, which is commonly used in powerlifting to compare totals across weight classes. While the Wilks score is designed to measure powerlifting totals, the strength score is designed to measure strength per-lift.

The "total" strength score averages the highest scores in each category: The squat, floor pull, pull-up, horizontal press, and vertical press.

The score for a single muscle group is measured by a weighted average of the lifts which involve that muscle group.
